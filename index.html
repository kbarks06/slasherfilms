        <h2>Slasher Film Crash Course</h2>
        <h3>Under Construction</h3>

    <main>
        <p>This site will contain all you need to know about slasher horror films. I plan on making different pages hold the plots, characters, and information about different franchises that I personally enjoy. So page one will start with the first movie, page 2 will be second, page 3 for the third and page 4 for the fourth. This will mostly be an informative page as if the viewer wants to learn about the movies. The homepage will contain all the basic requirements that make a slasher film aswell as quick links that bring you to the other pages.</p>
